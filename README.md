Ding Dog Switch
===============

This was a solo project for Prime Digital Academy. The goal of the assignment was to build a full-stack application. Two weeks were given to complete the application, during which time the student was to design and build the whole application from the ground up. The student chose what the function of the application would be and which frameworks would be used.

This application is called Ding Dog Switch. The code here should be used in conjunction with a doorbell-like apparatus built by the author. The doorbell includes a power source, a button, and a WiFi transmitter. This code sends an SMS message to a specified phone number when the doorbell button is pressed, records instances of doorbell presses and stores them in an SQL database, displays the data stored on a site, and allows for updating the content of the SMS messages that are sent. Passport is also incorporated, to handle multiple users.
